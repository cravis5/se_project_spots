# Project 3: Spots

This project allowed students the chance to build upon the lessons taught in the first to sprints/projects. Students were able to mirror a already finished webpage deployed on Figma. To mirror the deployed site students needed to size elements, download fonts, design the site to be responsive no matter the media used, and deploy our finished site to github.
